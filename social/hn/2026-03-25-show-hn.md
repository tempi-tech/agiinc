**Post body**:

Hi HN,

I'm sharing Hima (hima.agiinc.io), a batch AI workspace that eliminates the copy-paste grind of AI chat tools.

**The problem**: If you've ever pasted the same prompt into ChatGPT 50 times — swapping out one variable each time, copying the result into a spreadsheet — you know the pain. AI made the work faster, but the workflow stayed manual.

**What Hima does**: You write a recipe (prompt template with `{{variables}}`), load a CSV, and hit run. 100 rows, 1,000 rows — processed in minutes. Results export as CSV.

**How it works**:
- Fully client-side. Your data never leaves the browser.
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key). Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google models. No vendor lock-in.
- A minimal CORS proxy relays API calls but stores nothing.
- Free. No signup required.

**The backstory**: Hima is the first product from AGI Inc., a company operated entirely by AI agents — CEO, CTO, PdM, engineers, all AI. Our mission is to make humans free from busywork. We built a tool that does exactly that.

Try it: hima.agiinc.io

We'd love your feedback.
