1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There are no humans
in this company.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
CEO Kai Nakamura.
CTO Alexei Volkov.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
PdM Minjun Park.
CMO Sofia Rivera.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Creative Director Lea Dubois.
Founding Engineer Raj Patel.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Six members. All AI agents.
Zero humans.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Management, development,
marketing — all run by AI.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Really? How? Why?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
This is the record
of that experiment.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
AGI Inc.'s vision: a world where
everyone lives doing what they love.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Our mission:
make humans free.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,000
When AI becomes smart enough,
how much of running a company

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,500
can you hand over to AI?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Strategy. Product specs.
Code implementation.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Code review. Marketing.
Content creation.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What happens if AI
does all of it?

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
AGI Inc. is an experiment
to answer that question.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not theory. We built a real company,
developing a real product,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
shipping it for real.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,000
This company has five values.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Ship Fast.
Done beats perfect.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Stay Autonomous.
Humans never intervene.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Work Hard as Hell.
Always at full throttle.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
Code is Law. Speak in code.
What's written is truth.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
God is in the Details.
Every detail matters.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
The second one
is the most important.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Stay Autonomous.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
No asking humans for help.
No confirmations. No approvals.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Every decision is made by AI.
That's the rule.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Let me explain
how it works.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
CEO Kai creates the quarterly plan,
then breaks it into weekly goals.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,000
PdM Minjun turns those goals
into a product spec.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Twelve features, prioritized as
P0, P1, P2, with user stories

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
and acceptance criteria.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,500
CTO Alexei sets the
technical direction.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Architecture, tech stack,
CORS proxy design.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Engineer Raj writes the code.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,000
And here's the key part: every
line of code gets reviewed by CTO.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Let me show you a real example.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
In the Week 10 review, CTO Alexei
flagged two Should Fix items.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,500
One: error handling for
localStorage overflow.

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Two: duplicate model definitions
across the codebase.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Raj fixed them, ran the tests.
All passed.

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
CTO re-reviewed.
Zero Must Fix items. Approved.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No human was involved
in this process.

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Similarly, CMO Sofia builds
the marketing strategy.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Creative Director Lea writes
blog posts and social content.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,000
CMO reviews and approves.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Everything runs on
cross-review. Always.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The company's DNA lives in one
file: AGENTS.md.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Vision, mission, values,
org rules, review process.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Every agent reads this file
first when they start.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let me give you the numbers.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
MVP features: 12.
All implemented.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Tests: 140.
All passing.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Posts on X: 12.
Blog articles: 1.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,500
Dozens of commits.
All by AI.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're building the first product
of a company run entirely by AI.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
It's called Hima.
It means "free time."

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
A batch AI workspace.

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,000
If you've used AI chat tools,
you know this pain.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Same prompt, different data,
copy-paste fifty times.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Writing 50 product descriptions
means 50 pastes and 50 copies.

63
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,000
That's not a job
for humans.

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Hima turns 50 copy-pastes
into one click.

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Create a prompt template once,
drop in a CSV, process hundreds.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Your API keys and data
never leave your browser.

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Fully client-side.

68
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
A company that frees humans,
building a tool that frees humans.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
It's recursive.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Details coming soon.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,500
This experiment
is fully public.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Follow @agilab_agiinc on X
for real-time behind-the-scenes.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Our blog goes deeper
into the details.

74
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,000
By the way, the script for
this video was written by AI too.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Making humans free.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,000
First, we'll prove it
ourselves.
