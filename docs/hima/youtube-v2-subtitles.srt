1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is Hima's 3-minute demo.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
From recipe creation to CSV batch run
and export.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We'll focus only on the actual operations.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First, create a recipe
in the left panel.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Enter a recipe name
and write your prompt template.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wrap variables in double braces,
like {{product_name}} and {{category}}.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hima detects variables automatically
as you type.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Choose a model,
for example gpt-4o.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then click Save.
Your recipe is now reusable.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Next, move to the right panel
and load your data.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Drag and drop a CSV file.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Map CSV columns
to recipe variables.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Map product name to {{product_name}},
and category to {{category}}.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Check the input row count.
Now you're ready to run.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Click Batch Run.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hima processes all rows at once.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The progress bar
and completed count update live.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Each row shows its status:
completed, running, or error.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Even if one row fails,
the whole batch keeps going.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You only review
what actually needs attention.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the run finishes,
open the results table.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Input and output are paired
row by row.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Expand a row
to read the full generated text.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If it looks good,
click Export CSV.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now you can move the results
into spreadsheets or other tools.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The workflow is only four steps:
recipe, CSV, run, export.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Create a recipe.
Load CSV.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Run in batch.
Export results.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Free and no sign-up required.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Add your API key,
and start right away.
